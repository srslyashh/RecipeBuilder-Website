# Recipe Builder Site
By: Kathleen Ashley, Devin Bright, Nicola Sisca, and Kaitlyn Holmes

For the final project, we will be implementing an application called “Yummy Recipe”, in which users are able to search through a vast assortment of ingredients to create their own recipe. To create this, we will store a list of ingredients that produces a picture and the name of it when shown on screen. There will be a pop-up window that includes the favorite ingredients where users can save and cache their recipe. The favorite tab will contain all saved recipes. For each ingredient in the list, we’ll store the following information:
 - The name of the ingredient
 - A photo for the ingredient
 - Whether or not it is in the current recipe
